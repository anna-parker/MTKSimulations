## Pipeline Steps

The Polytomy Resolution Simulation pipeline assesses the improvement in tree reconstruction when MultiTreeKnit is used, as opposed to when standard TreeKnit is used with only two tree segments. Influenza is comprised of eight RNA segments, segments can reassort leading to each segment having a potentially unique ancestry. Therefore, each segment is typically used individually to reconstruct a separate phylogenetic divergence tree. The most widely used segments are NA and HA which are each approximately 1.5kB, at influenza's standard rate of mutation NA and HA segments are often not very diverged, meaning that multiple sequences might have the same sequence or a similar enough sequence such that a binary tree structure cannot be reconstructed from the data. Internal nodes often have multiple children, this is called a polytomy. In such a case we say that a tree is not full resolved - in NA and HA the resolution rate (ratio of internal nodes to leaves in a tree) is approximately 0.3. This means that much of the true tree structure is lost. 

An unresolved tree is equivalent to removing internal branches from a fully resolved (binary) tree. While inferring maximally compatible clades (MCCs) between a tree pair TreeKnit additionally tries to resolve each tree by adding internal branches from the other tree if they are compatible - i.e. in a MCC trees should share topology and a branch in a MCC seen in one segment tree due to mutations in that segment can be added to the other segment tree even if no mutations occurred there.

1. Use the julia package [ARGTools](https://github.com/PierreBarrat/ARGTools) to simulate recombination of eight segments with the flu/kingman coalescence model. See the [docs](https://github.com/PierreBarrat/ARGTools/tree/extended_newick_clean#simulations) for information on how these simulations are completed. Obtain individual segment trees for each segment in the ARG.
2. Randomly remove internal branches with probability $$e^{\frac{-\tau}{cN}}.$$ The parameter $N$ corresponds to the population size and $\tau$ is the branch length - branches are scaled to generation number as ARGTools uses a coalescence model. The parameter $c$ is determined in [MTKTools](https://github.com/anna-parker/MTKTools) and has been chosen to result in trees with a desired resolution rate (typically between 0.3 and 0.4 for influenza).
3. Take random subsamples of size $2 \leq K \leq 8$ trees and use MultiTreeKnit to infer the MCCs of all tree pairs in this random subset, in this process TreeKnit will additionally resolve each tree using every other tree (The $K=2$ case corresponds to standard TreeKnit). 
4. Compute the improvement in tree reconstruction using the RF distance between true trees and trees seen and resolved by TreeKnit. Additionally, calculate the accuracy of the new branches using splits.
5. Write a summary of results to a txt file.
6. Plot results.
7. Remove unnecessary files and zip output files.

#### Rounds Pipeline

This directory also contains a subdirectory with a pipeline to assess the impact of multiple rounds on tree reconstruction - the same technique is employed as above except that now the number of rounds used in MultiTreeKnit is an additional parameter. TreeKnit allows users to set the number of rounds of inference - if rounds is set to greater than 1 after the initial MCC inference and tree pair resolution TreeKnit will use the resolved trees from the previous round as input and the computed MCCs as a consistency constraint (if `consistent = true`) for this round of MCC inference and tree resolution.


## Tree resolution metrics

Comparing branches with varying topologies presents various challenges. This is why we identify branches using splits. If a branch between a node and its ancestor is removed from a tree the tree is "split" into two parts - the clade below the node (with the node as it's root) and the rest of the tree. Each of these parts can be identified by the leaves in it. Thus, a split is a tuple of leaves and there exists a unique mapping from a branch in a tree to a split.

#### RF (Robinsonâ€“Foulds) distance 

The RF distance of two trees (with the same leaves) is defined as the the number of unique splits in each tree, or $$RF(T_1, T_2) = |S_1| + |S_2| - 2*| S_1 \cap S_2 |,$$ typically this is still scaled by the maximal RF distance which is $$|S_1| + |S_2| - 2$$ (the root always has the same split).

In the plots we show the improvement in RF distance after the unresolved trees $T_i$ have been resolved by TreeKnit during MCC inference $\hat{T_i}$ i.e. $$RF(T_i, T_j) - RF(\hat{T_i}, \hat{T_j}).$$

#### New Split Accuracy

Furthermore, we actually know which exact splits are missing from the tree unresolved tree and which are added by TreeKnit. This allows us to plot the fraction of missing splits that are correctly added back by TreeKnit and the fraction of incorrect splits (also scaled by the total number of missing splits for easier comparison).
